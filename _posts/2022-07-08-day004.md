# Hooks

Yesterday, I studied about Hooks. But, I need to make by myself more.

I want to make CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) with React Hooks.

## Adding memo

First of all, I try to make Adding memo function.

I made simple input and memo table like this.

It was not hard to make table and input, but it's little bit hard to make adding memo function.

To conclude, I failed to make adding memo function today.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const AddMemoForm = props => {
  const initialFormState = { id: null, category: '', content: '' }
  const [addMemo, setAddMemo] = useState(initialFormState)

  const InputChange = event => {
    const { name, value } = event.target

    setAddMemo({ ...addMemo, [name]: value })
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <label>category</label>
      <input type="text" name="category" value={addMemo.category} onChange={InputChange} />
      <label>content</label>
      <input type="text" name="content" value={addMemo.content} onChange={InputChange} />
      <button>Add new memo</button>
    </form>
  )
}

export default AddMemoForm
```

You can see all code here!

I thought after adding onChange event, memo will adding to list.

But, as you see it doesn't work.

I think I need to submitting memo data to Index component.

So, I'm gonna make more tomorrow.
