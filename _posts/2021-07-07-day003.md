### React router

I want to make basic menu of web site using React router.

This is the ouput of today.

I make basic SPA with React router and little css.

Before using router, we need to install React router.

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

and import react router like this.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```

### How to use?

```javascript
<Router>
  <div className="routerWrap">
    <div className="linkWrap">
      <Link to="/" className="linkStyle">
        Home
      </Link>
      <Link to="/MyWork" className="linkStyle">
        MyWork page
      </Link>
      <Link to="/MyList" className="linkStyle">
        MyList
      </Link>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>This is simple SPA(single page app)</div>

  <br />
  <br />

  <Route path="/MyWork" component={MyWork} />
  <Route path="/MyList" component={MyList} />
</Router>
```

This is part of my code.

First, I need to wrap 'Router' to all.

Then I'm using 'Link' to load other page and 'Route' load component that I made like {MyWork}.
