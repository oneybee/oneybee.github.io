# Day 001

ðŸ‘‰ [Day001 github link](https://github.com/oneybee/100days-of-react/tree/master/day001-props-state-basic)

First of all, I studied props and state using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (Create React App).

I plan to make React project from scratch, but at first I thought it would be effective to using CRA.

### props & state

Many articles said props, state are important part of React.

So, I tried to make examples of props and state at Day 001.

This is my output.

It looks not beautiful but I think it's good to understand basic of props and state.

```javascript
<div className="props-wrap">
  <h2>Using Props</h2>
  <MyComponent value="3000" />
</div>
```

I worte props value to 3000.

Props is static data that parent component give to chile. It's immutable.

State data can change. And when state change we need to use setState().
