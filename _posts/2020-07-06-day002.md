# Day 002

ðŸ‘‰ [Day002 github link](https://github.com/oneybee/100days-of-react/tree/master/day002-react-router)

React use virtul DOM. I understood virtul DOM doesn't reload all view when some view changes.

Just reload part of view.

So, It's reduce time, can make SPA(Single Page App) and user also feel fast than before.

I've received a lot of help with below post.

### React router

I want to make basic menu of web site using React router.

This is the ouput of today.

I make basic SPA with React router and little css.

Before using router, we need to install React router.

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

and import react router like this.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```

### How to use?

```javascript
<Router>
  <div className="routerWrap">
    <div className="linkWrap">
      <Link to="/" className="linkStyle">
        Home
      </Link>
      <Link to="/MyWork" className="linkStyle">
        MyWork page
      </Link>
      <Link to="/MyList" className="linkStyle">
        MyList
      </Link>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>This is simple SPA(single page app)</div>

  <br />
  <br />

  <Route path="/MyWork" component={MyWork} />
  <Route path="/MyList" component={MyList} />
</Router>
```

This is part of my code.

First, I need to wrap 'Router' to all.

Then I'm using 'Link' to load other page and 'Route' load component that I made like {MyWork}.
