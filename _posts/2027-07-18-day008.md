# New posting

Maybe it took 6-7 days for my new posting. I had to do other works, so I didn't have much time.

Anyway, I want to fetch API data and make some little project with that data.

It takes a long time to fetch data.

# Fetching API data

I tried to fetch data using useEffect.

I'm using this [API data.](https://www.football-data.org/)

It's football data but it needs an API token.

There are many resources about how to fetch data using useEffect but all of them using API that doesn't need an API key(or token).

So, it was hard to fetch with API token.

I eventually found it, but I spent a lot of time on it.

This is my code.

```javascript
import React, { Component, useState, useEffect } from 'react'

var obj = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'X-Auth-Token': 'Your-API-token',
  },
}

function App() {
  useEffect(async () => {
    var season = ['https://api.football-data.org/v2/competitions/PD/scorers?season=2017', 'https://api.football-data.org/v2/competitions/PD/scorers?season=2018']

    const response1 = await fetch(season[0], obj)
    const response2 = await fetch(season[1], obj)

    var data1 = await response1.json()
    var data2 = await response2.json()

    console.log(data1)
    console.log(data2)
  }, [])

  return <div>load data</div>
}

export default App
```

And when I check console, it looks like this.

You can see the fetched data from the console screen.

I'll try something to the API data with React(or React hooks) tomorrow.
