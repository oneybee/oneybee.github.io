# Delete

Today, I make delete function on CRUD app.

It's easier than adding memo function.

👉 [Day006 github link](https://github.com/oneybee/100days-of-react/tree/master/day04-06-CRUD-with-Hooks)

And I make codes to my index.js file.

```javascript
const deleteMemo = id => {
  setMemos(memos.filter(memo => memo.id !== id))
}
```

```javascript
<button onClick={() => props.deleteMemo(memo.id)}>Delete</button>
```

And add onClick event to my delete button.

## Edit memo

After making delete function, I try to make edit memo function.

I wrote many wrong codes and I didn't finish edit function today.
