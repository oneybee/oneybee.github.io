# Delete

Today, I make delete function on CRUD app.

It's easier than adding memo function.

And I make codes to my index.js file.

```javascript
const deleteMemo = id => {
  setMemos(memos.filter(memo => memo.id !== id))
}
```

And add onClick event to my delete button.

```javascript
<button onClick={() => props.deleteMemo(memo.id)}>Delete</button>
```

You can check all my codes here ðŸ‘‰ [Day006 github link](https://github.com/oneybee/100days-of-react/tree/master/day04-07-CRUD-with-Hooks)

## Edit memo

After making delete function,

I want to make edit function like this example gif.

I try to make edit memo function, but I make many wrong codes. ðŸ˜¨

I think I can finish it tomorrow.
