# Day 001

First of all, I studied props and state using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (Create React App).

I plan to make React project from scratch, but at first I thought it would be effective to using CRA.

### props & state

Many articles said props, state are important part of React.

So, I tried to make examples of props and state at Day 001.

This is my output.

It looks not beautiful but I think it's good to understand basic of props and state.
