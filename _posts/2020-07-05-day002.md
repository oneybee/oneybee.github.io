# Day 002

ðŸ‘‰ [Day002 github link](https://github.com/oneybee/100days-of-react/tree/master/day002-react-router)

React use virtul DOM. I understood virtul DOM doesn't reload view when some view changes.

So, It's reduce time, can make SPA(Single Page App) and user also feel fast than before.

I've received a lot of help with below post.

### React router

This is the ouput of today.

I make basic SPA with React router and little css.

Before using router, we need to install React router.

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```
