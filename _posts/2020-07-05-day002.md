# Day 002

React use virtul DOM. I understood virtul DOM doesn't reload view when some view changes.

So, It's reduce time, can make SPA(Single Page App) and user also feel fast than before.

### React router

This is the ouput of today.

I make basic SPA with React router and little css.

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

Before using router, we need to install React router.
